divide and conquer

Step 1. Divide the points in S into two subsets, S1 and S2 by a vertical line x = c so that half the points lie to the left or on the line,
and half the points lie to the right or on the line (c is the median of the x coordinates)

Step 2. Recursively find the closest pairs for the left and right subsets. 

Step 3 (Revised). Let d1 be the distance of the closest pair on the left and d2 be the distance of the closest pair on the right. 
Let d = min{d1,d2}. Consider the vertical strip 2d-wide centered at x = c. Let Y be the subset of points in this vertical strip of width 2d. 

Step 4. For each point p in Y, try to find points in Y that are within d units of p. Only 7 points in Y that follow p need to be considered
